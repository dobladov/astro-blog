## Blogging about blogging

I realized most of the drafts I wrote in 2024 were about blogging, while some meta might be interesting including this post, I don't want to be the guy that only talks about blogging, the purpose of blogging should be for sharing knowledge and experiences, not for explaining how to blog, probably Aristotle would have wrote this in his blog, but I'm not Aristotle.

> “The Purpose of ~~Knowledge~~Blogging is Action, not ~~Knowledge~~Blogging” Aristotle

This led me to delete those drafts, and I don't have any regrets, in fact nothing that you can find anywhere else was lost.

## Negativity

Some of the other drafts talked about the [dead internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Internet_theory), and how I'm less and less interested in the internet, and this is true, during 2024 I both gave another try to social networks and gave up, I deleted my Twitter account due to the amount of negativity there, rarely finding anything new and interesting, the only thing I miss is the creativity of gamedev and programmers, but more and more of the content was simply commercial, rarely there's people who simply are proud of their work and want to share it, instead everyone was selling something including me even if I made no money out of it.

Then I tried Mastodon and BlueSky, in Mastodon, the content felt completely unappealing to me, maybe because I chose [mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/explore) for my instance, politics, cat pics and rights are the more common topics and I like that others have a place to discuss them but I'm not interested, definitely a more tech-focused instance would have been better for me, but fragmentation and content made me give up on it.

[BlueSky](https://bsky.app/) felt somehow better, I liked the idea behind their protocol, I think they do moderation in a good way, and it feels like a good alternative to Twitter, but again I'm not sure if I chose the wrong people to follow, but most of the content was meta about the protocol, cats, and politics.

I even invested some time to understand how their [AT protocol](https://atproto.com/) works, I love how they use domains as handles and other ideas of owning your data, but given that they still need to implement important parts of the protocol like scopes developing something on it didn't feel right at the moment.

Which led me to think "What am I doing with my time"? I consume all this content that I don't even enjoy, and then deleted the accounts.

Ironically [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/) is the only social network of any value for myself now, only following people I know and avoiding reels and other never-ending content, I simply have it on my phone (web app) with a timer to limit how much I use it; this keeps me connected to my friends and family which is real value, I do hate that it is owned by Meta, but both posting and commenting to people I care increases my connection to them.

In general my only social interactions beside the mentioned are some occasional comments on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) and searches on Reddit but they are so sporadic that they barely count.

## Focusing on what matters

Given that I don't like the web so much, the best thing I could do in 2024 was to get away from it and focus on other things, I started to take Calisthenics more seriously which had the best outcome possible, this year to my surprise, I can do some Calisthenics tricks, like handstands, muscle-up, L-sit, and my physique is great, the amount of benefits to my body have been amazing and training has become a highlight of the day where I feel great instead of being a hurdle, in fact I'm training so much that I have to take periods of healing, which is a good problem to have and I'm reducing with more knowledge about the topic.

Because of the content I found on the Internet is not interesting I moved more to reading books, and more importantly, now I allowed myself to abandon books that I don't find interesting which was killing my will to read, this boosted my other hobbies with amazing books like [Overcoming Gravity](https://stevenlow.org/overcoming-gravity/), never have I read a more well-written book about sports being a topic I never thought it could be interesting in reading, I'm reading more of what amuses me instead of feeling I need to learn something new, focusing on Sci-Fi instead of non-fiction.

For 2025 I hope to write more about my hobbies and less about the web, focus on what's positive and what I enjoy, and hopefully you enjoy it too.
