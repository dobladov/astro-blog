## Introduction about the piano

I bought a second hand [Yamaha DGX-620 Grand Piano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamaha_DGX-620) also known as the <i>YPG-625</i>, the <abbr title="Yamaha Portable Grand">YPG</abbr> stands for Yamaha Portable Grand, sure portable..., after carying it for 10 minutes by myself my back hurt for 3 days.

## Opinions and problems

Overall I'm very happy with it, while I still don't know much about playing paino, it does look and sounds great, but it came with problem that bothered me a lot, the seller did not mention it until I went to buy it, the screen was broken, it's a common known manufacturing problem for these models that looking online affects a lot of people, fortunately due to this reason I got a huge discount, only 70€ to buy the full piano, there's people selling it with a broken screen for around 200 € minimum, the cost new was of ~700€ so a 90% discount.
The problem is very simple, the ribbon connector for he display loses connection overtime, due to a very thin solder that's in tension.

## Possible first solution

This video shows a very simple solution which seems to work for most who tried, simply add foldback clips to increase the preassure of the connection.

This solution sounds great, low repair cost (only 2 foldback clips), without much risk besides open it, so I tried.

After removing around 100 screws (that was painful), the case can be removed and the board can be accesed.

{/* <!-- ![Removed board and screws]() --> */}

Now that's open the process it's easy, after remvoving the ribbons and the 4 screws around the board, the main board will go out and the display can be accessed.
The display has two ribbons that each control half of the screen, I had to fix both in my case, so this requires to remove 2 additional screws to acces the second ribbon.

I isolated the clips with masking tape, to make sure the circuits will not short with the metalic clips.

After this I checked the screen and unfortunately it only fixed half of it, I tried adding more pressure, but nothing worked, so I gave up after a while.

{/* <!-- ![Result of the fix, half the screen it's not working]() --> */}

## Second option

At this poin I thought my only solution was to replace the screen, this was problematic for two reasons, number one, a new screen cost a minimum of [60€ on aliexprss](https://de.aliexpress.com/item/1005004712449602.html) sometimes as much as I paid for the whole piano, reson two is that it requires an iron solder, I did want an excuse to buy a [PINECIL](https://pine64.com/product/pinecil-smart-mini-portable-soldering-iron/), an amazing tool, but this will add to the cost, and I decided it was not worth it, besides the piano works great, and the MIDI input can be used without a screen.

Here it's when I thought of a differnet solution that so far I didn't see online, if the solder had desolder why not try to melt it, I do not have a heat gun but I do have a hair dryer so I gave it a try.

The process is almost the same but instead of adding pins for preassure, I just heated both screen connectors for around 5 minutes using the hair dryer's max temperature, somtimes adding preassure with the plasticl nozzle.

After mounting it again I got a gorgeous working screen.
